        <h1>CSCI 466 Assignment 8</h1>
            <p>This is my first paragraph of my first ever HTML webpage. It contains a lot of useful information. The capitol of Illinois is Springfield, see isnt that super useful?
                The blue whale is so large that if you laid it out on top a football field, the game would be canceled. This is valuable information that you now have because you saw my
                webpage. Northern Illinois is a great univeristy! Wow! My HTML webpage even lets you as the viewer see some cool emojis &#x1F602. If you

                Having taken a lot of online courses due to covid, this course is one of the best that I have been in. The lecture videos are super clear and to the point while also
                having a fun tone and they often make me laugh. The assignments in the course are fun and enganging and I really enjoy doing them. I just really like this class and

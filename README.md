This Repository contains all of my projects I completed during my time in school.


-----------------------Harper College-----------------------

These classes had 2 types of assignments, Labs and Projects. Labs
were smaller, simpler programs designed to help me build skills 
in certain topics. Projects were larger more complex programs
designed to test my skills learned from completing the Labs.
The instructor gave each assignment a difficulty score which he 
called "Levels", and required a certian number of Levels to be 
submitted at certain points during the semester.

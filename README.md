# School Projects Repository

This repository contains all of my projects completed during my time in school.

## Harper College

During my time at Harper College, assignments were divided into two types: Labs and Projects. Labs were smaller, simpler programs designed to help build skills in specific topics. Projects were larger, more complex programs designed to test the skills learned from completing the Labs. Each assignment was given a difficulty score, referred to as "Levels," and a certain number of Levels were required to be submitted at various points during the semester.
